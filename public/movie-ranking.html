<h1>The Best Movies According to Ameerah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Brotherhood</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies.</p>
<h3>Gangs of Lagos</h3>
<p>I love action movies and this is not an exception,coupled with the fact that it is an eye opener to some of the evil acts in politics.Although it is not perfectly true and i feel that is why it is a movie, a movie ought to depict reality and it has done just that.</p>
<h3> Flawsome</h3>
<p> The bond the four friends share in the movie is one of the things i cherish in the movie,although they have their misunderstandings and it never breaks them. Friends like sister's</p>                          </p>
